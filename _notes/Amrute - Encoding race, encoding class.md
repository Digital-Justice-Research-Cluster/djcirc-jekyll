Amrute, S. (2016). _Encoding race, encoding class: Indian IT workers in Berlin_. Duke University Press.

- Book is "about how ==knowledge work realigns and reimagines race and class and how these in turn give rise to alternatives within the neoliberal colonization of life by work.==" (p. 2)
	- 2023 - ChatGPT hiring foreign cheap-labour programmers? 
- the duality that race creates: IT workers are both upwardly mobile middle class subjects and subjects whose labour is "cheapened" by precarious, project-based short term work
- book looks at "alignments, realignments, and misalignments of race and class in transnational coding economies"
	- most scholars of capitalism understand work in the context that the book talks about as "knowledge work, cognitive labor, immaterial labor, or, more simply, post-Fordist, postfactory production" - the gap:

They all—sometimes despite an explicit interest in embodiment—imagine the cognitive worker as a universal, unmarked subject. (p. 2)
	- book looks at how racializations intersect with class aspiration - Amrute's approach treats race as a concept in flux - "since racialization as I use it does not imply an ultimate truth about race"
- ==industrial capitalism== - IT workers are bulked together - p. 3
- Tie to "good life" in Berlant - p. 5 - "cruel optimism"
- Workers of all kinds are racialized - Irish workers passionate/suited to hard labour, Asian worker's "nimble hands"

*Encoding Race, Encoding Class* argues that cognitive labor both opposes manual labor and is embodied. Concomitantly, Indian programmers are elite, privileged workers in cognitive economies *and* racialized workers troubling such economies.
- Discussion on "automist Marxism" - p. 5 and:

In this book, therefore, ==I extend the autonomist analysis of capitalism put forward by such theorists as Virno and Berardi to encompass race and class==. It is not that they ignore how embodiments of race and class imbricate with creative and communicative work. (p. 17)

Link to [[Berardi - Futurability]] - ==use of *eros*== 

According to Berardi’s analysis, we are incited to share and be open to multiple kinds of impulses; yet, these impulses are directed
toward a particular idea of happiness rooted in accumulation
- IT workers in Berlin occupy this space/eros 

- Amrute's field work (p. 8-11)
	- participant-observer - workers thought she was/could be a risk to talk to
	- refers to subjects "interlocutors"
	- 18 months of shadowing and hanging out with a group of Indian IT workers

My research is more concerned with what happens at the boundary between the office and the world outside the office—with moments of encounter and translation that define the particular standpoint of the Indian middle-class coder. (p. 12)

- distinction between ==race== and ==racialization==
	- Race helps divide native and “foreign” populations, old and new styles of working, and stable identities and flexible ones.
	- I investigate how racialization opens up a variety of ways of imagining the relationship of work and worker subjectivity.

I argue that in coding economies racialization happens when the question is raised: is being good at programming fixed in certain kinds of bodies? ==I use the terms *race* and *racialization* here to describe how work ethics, the capacity to labor in particular ways, and cultural knowledge are “epidermalized,” as Fanon writes—mapped onto the skin, clothing, smell, and mannerisms of living bodies.==
- interested in how the race of the Indian IT worker is used to generalize what makes a good cognitive worker (p. 15)

- Work is informed by Berardi, Deleuze and Virno - who "investigate a kind of captialism that extracts surplus value from the circulation of signs"
	- Being Indian becomes synonymous with accepting precarious contracts, extending the work day and performing cultural knowledge as part of the work - p. 17
- "Making the middle class abroad" (p. 18-19) - Indian IT workers are both migrant workers and "desiring citizen-consumers" 

While the demands of working hard, in short-term labor contracts, and in often-repetitive work clearly support economically middle-class aspirations, Indian programmers also think of themselves as refusing neoliberalism’s most stringent demands. 
- both cheap labour and as a rising elite

- ==Marx== and machinery - transforming worker into a cog in the machine - hijacking of "labor power"

Indian programmers voiced a similar critique when they pointed out what code, in their opinion, ought to do: to solve common problems and erase political boundaries, especially the ones that restrict their own abilities to migrate...When Indian it workers talk about code, they talk about it in ways that echo how Marx talked about the machine, as a technology that ought to free them to pursue their many-sidedness but has instead been harnessed to a business strategy that sees them mostly as expendable, cheap labor. (p. 21)
- on "freedom" in this context (p. 22) and time

- Read  ==Chapter 3, “Proprietary Freedoms in an it Office,”== discusses the strategies Indian programmers use to be successful in short-term work contracts, including framing the work as a necessary, temporary step on the way to elite status and thinking of programming skills as a kind of wealth they control.
