Hacking, I. (1990). _The taming of chance_. Cambridge University Press.

Causality, long the bastion of metaphysics, was toppled, or at least tilted: ==the past does not determine exactly what happens next==. (p. 1)
- 19th century -  "world mkght be regular and yet not subject to universal laws of nature. A space was cleared for chance"
- Society became statistical - probability
- ==the erosion of determinism:== main concern of the book
In 1889 ==Francis Galton, founder of the biometric school of statistical research, not to mention eugenics,== wrote that the chief law of probability ‘reigns with serenity and in complete effacement amidst the wildest confusion’.^ By the end of the century chance had attained the respectability of a Victorian valet, ready to be the loyal servant of the natural, biological and social sciences.
- Link to [[Murphy - The economization of life]] - discussion of eugenics

- paradox: the more indeterminism, the more the control 
- social and personal laws were to be a matter of probabilities/chances

People are normal if they conform to the central tendency of such laws, while those at the extremes are pathological. Few of us fancy being pathological, so ‘most of us’ try to make ourselves normal, which in turn affects what is normal. (p. 2)
- "avalance"/preoccupation for counting/numbers - American census
	- printing of numbers = new technologies for classifying and enumerating - new bureaucracies with the authority and continuity to deploy the technology

Categories had to be invented into which people could conveniently fall in order to be counted. The systematic collection of data about people has affected not only the ways in which we conceive of a society, but also the ways in which we describe our neighbour. (p. 3)
- Marx: who had more of an effect on class consciousness? Marx or the reports
- What does the avalanche of numbers have to do with determinism? "Determinism was subverted by laws of chance. To believe there were such laws one needed law-like statistical regularities in large populations." (p. 3)
- role of control in enumeration:
We shall find that the roots of the idea lie in the notion that one can improve - control - a deviant subpopulation by enumeration and classification.

- Success story of probability: lists definitions of domains of success (p. 4)
- Metaphysics is the science of the ultimate states of the universe.
- **==Epistemology is the theory of knowledge and belief.==**  
- Logic is the theory of inference and argument.
- Ethics is in part the study of what to do. Probability cannot dictate values, but it now lies at the basis of all reasonable choice made by officials. No public decision, no risk analysis, no environmental impact, no military strategy can be conducted without decision theory couched in terms of probabilities. 

Probability is, then, the philosophical success story of the first half of the twentieth century.
- preoccupation of probabilty and danger
- The "imperialism of probabilities"

The avalanche of numbers, the erosion of determinism, and the invention of normalcy are embedded in the grander topics of the Industrial Revolution.
- professional lust for precision in measurement (p. 4)
- Hacking's project: grasp the conditions that made possible our present organization of concepts into two wisdoms
	- Physical indeterminism
	- statistical information developed for purposes of social control

- "making up people" - enumeration requires categorization, and that definiing new classes of people for the purposes of statistics has consequences for the ways in which we concieve of others and think of our won possibilities and potentialities
- using AC Crombie's style of reasoning:

Crombie had in mind enduring ways of thinking such as (a) the simple postulation and deduction in the mathematical sciences, (b) experimental exploration, (c) hypothetical construction of models by analogy, (d) ordering of variety by comparison and taxonomy, (e) statistical analysis of regularities of populations, and (f) historical derivation of genetic development. (p. 6)

- 1660 - idea of probability came into being - "great spurt" of statistical thinking did not occur until the 19th century
- notion of population (p. 6)

Most professionals now believe that representative sampling gives more accurate information about a population than an exhaustive census.
- "unthinkable" during most of 19th century
- style of scientific reasoning has had to evolve

A proposition can be assessed as true-or-false only when there is some style of reasoning and investigation that helps determine its truth value. (p. 7)

- ==Central Claim== - many of our philosophical conceptions of probability were fomred by the nature of the transtion from immediately precding Renaissance conceptions (p. 9)

I write of the taming of chance, that is, of the way in which apparently chance or irregular events have been brought under the control of natural or social law. The world became not more chancy, but far less so. Chance, which was once the superstition of the vulgar, became the centrepiece of natural and social science, or so genteel and rational people are led to believe. But how can chance ever be tamed? (p. 10)
