Bhambra, G.K., Nisancioglu, K., Gebrial, D. (2018). _Decolonizing the university_. Pluto Press.

- Book aims to critically examine calls to 'decolonise the university' within a wider context
	- look at the prominence of decolonialization framework

How is it distinct from other forms of anti-racist organising in institutions such as the university, and why has it gained particular purchase in the contemporary higher education context? ==What does it mean to apply a term that emerged from a specific historical, political and geographic context, to today’s world?== And what are the possibilities and dangers that come with calls to decolonise the university?
- good basis for understanding

- ==Definition of decolonizing== - two key referents (p. 2)
1. A way of thinking about the world which takes colonialism, empire and racism as its empirical and discursive objects of study - "resituates these phenemona" (p. 2) as "key shaping forces of the contemporary world"
2. Offers alternative ways of thinking about the world and alternative forms of political praxis
	- a contested term - many viewpoints/perspectives
	- one of the key challenges presented to Eurocentric forms of knowledge is an insistence on positionality and plurality - specifically: "the impact that taking ‘difference’ seriously would make to standard understandings"
- The point is to not just deconstruct but transform 
	- anti-colonial approaches that eschew Eurocentricism "through the construction of new universality" 

- The book - written from the perspective of academics and students in a university context

It seeks to question the epistemological authority assigned uniquely to the Western university as the privileged site of knowledge production and to contribute to the broader project of decolonising through a discussion of strategies and interventions emanating from within the imperial metropoles. (p. 3)
- looks at anti-raceist/colonialist resistence to the imperial metropole central to building anti-colonial movements in the global South (p. 3)
- ==book aims to reveal the relationship between coloniality and pedagogy

- ==Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang== - ‘decolonization is not a metaphor’

They argue that the language of decolonising has been adopted in ways which empty it of its specific political aims; namely the repatriation of dispossessed indigenous land. Such emptying might include educational practices that seek to move away from Eurocentric frames of reference or using the language of decolonisation while pursuing a politics distinct from indigenous struggles over land.

Tuck/Yang:
The easy absorption, adoption, and transposing of decolonization is yet another form of settler appropriation. When we write about decolonization, we are not offering it as a metaphor; it is not an approximation of other experiences of oppression. Decolonization is not a swappable term for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. ==Decolonization doesn’t have a synonym==.
- 'moves to innocence' - placates settler guilt and complicity

==Tuck and Yang insist on decolonisation as a struggle over dispossession, the repatriation of indigenous land and the seizing of imperial wealth. ==Such a project is less about seeking reconciliation with settler pasts, presents and futures, but about pursuing what is ‘irreconcilable within settler colonial relations and incommensurable between decolonising projects and other social justice projects’ (p. 4)
- Authors complicate the assertion that decolonialization is about repatriation to indigenous people and extend and deepen their political warning - extend that decolonialization is not a metaphor

- The book aims to demonstrate that colonialism can't be redufced to historically and geographically specific articulations of the colonial project - specifically settler-colonialism in the Americas
	- can't only target dispossession of land, ignores other ways that colonialism is reproduced - "financialized neo-colonialism today" (p. 5)
		- this is my research's entrant into data colonialism
- ==Contention of the book== - the university as an continuation/instrument of colonial practices:

Subjects of Western scholarship are enduringly pale, male (and often stale); where people of colour do appear, they are all too often tokenistically represented, spoken on behalf of, or reduced to objects of scholarship. 

- Book's organization: three parts - Contexts/History, Instituational Initiatives, Decolonial Reflections most relevant is the chapter on 'decolonial turn in philosophy' 

As such, they argue, simply diversifying the field is not sufficient, it requires a more thoroughgoing decolonisation of ‘structural problems and deep-seated habits’ across the ‘various aspects of philosophy as a field and as a practice’ – this is something that is manifestly visible in their co-authored and intergenerational practice in the writing of this chapter. (p. 7)
