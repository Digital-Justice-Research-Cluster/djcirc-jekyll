- Book tackles systems of ==classification and standardization==
	- The "invisible" standards and classification systems
	- crossroads of socialogy of knowledge and technology, history and information science (p. 6)
- Authors point to the gap in social sciences, information sciences in tackling issues of "imbricated" classification sytems

Remarkably for such a central part of our lives, we stand for the most part in formal ignorance of the social and moral order created by these invisible , potent entities. Their impact is indisputable , and as Foucault reminds us, inescapable. (p. 3)

A few sociologists have done detailed studies of individual categories linked with social movements, such as the diagnosis of homosexuality as an illness and its demedicalization in the wake of gay and lesbian civil rights. Information scientists work every day on the design , delegation, and choice of classification systems and standards, yet few see them as artifacts embodying moral and aesthetic choices that in turn craft people's identities, aspirations, and dignity. (p. 3-4)
- ==the gap in literature==: none of disciplines/social movements (p. 4) have addressed the "pragmatics of the invisible forces of categories and standards int he modern built world, especially the modern information technology world"
	- Foucault comes close with "practical archaeology"
	- Authors contend that we have a "moral and ethical agaenda in our querying of these systems"

Each standard and each category valorizes some point of view and silences another. (p. 5)

- ==Hypertextuality== - Every link in hypertext creates a category. That is, it reflects some judgment about two or more objects : they are the same, or alike, or functionally linked, or linked as part of an unfolding series. (p. 7)
- Any IS design - must consider use and user semantics or it "will become either oppressive or irrelevant" - AI? 
	- notes rapid change (in 1999) of IS

As we evolve the classifications of habit-grow common fingertips with respect to linkages and networks-we will be faced with some choices. How standardized will our indexes become? What forms of freedom of association (among people, texts and people, and texts) do we want to preserve and which are no longer useful? Who will decide these matters? (p. 8)

- the ==magic== of technology?
- ==the book== attempts to answer the following:
1. What work do classifications and standards do?
2. Who does that work?
3. What happens to the cases that do not fit?

- Definitions of ==classification== and ==standardization== (p. 10):

A ==**classification**== is a spatial, temporal, or spatia-temporal segmentation of the world.
- idealized definition includes:
1. There are consistent, unique classificatory principles in operation.
2. The categories are mutually exclusive.
3. The system is complete.
- this idealized scenario is non-existent:

No real-world working classification system that we have looked at meets these " simple" requirements and we doubt that any ever could. In the case of unique classificatory systems, people disagree about their nature ; they ignore or misunderstand them; or they routinely mix together different and contradictory principles. (p. 11)

- On second point:
...mutual exclusivity may be impossible in practice, as when there is disagreement or ambivalence about the membership of an object in a category. (p. 12)
	- medical systems - the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)

In the case of the lCD, diagnostic nomenclature and the terms in the lCD itself were conflated in the American system of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), much to the dismay of some medical researchers. In many cases the ICD represents a compromise between conflicting schemes.   (p. 12)

- Authors take a Pragmatist turn (things perceived as real are real in their consequences):
For the purposes o f this book, w e take a broad enough definition so that anything consistently called a classification system ==and treated as such== can be included in the term. (p. 13)

- ==**Standards**== - standards are crucial components of the larger argument (p. 13-14)
1. A "standard" is any set of agreed-upon rules for the production of (textual or material) objects.
2. A standard spans more than one community of practice
3. Standards are deployed in making things work together over distance and heterogeneous metrics.
4. Legal bodies often enforce standards, be these mandated by professional organizations, manufacturers' organizations, or the state
5. There is no natural law that the best standard shall win-QWERTY, Lotus 1 2 3 , DOS, and V H S are often cited as examples in this context.
	- outdated
6. Standards have significant inertia and can be very difficult and expensive to change.

* ==Latour== on standards - economic resources spent creating + maintaining standard versus producing "pure" science

At the same time, every successful standard imposes a classification system, at the very least between good and bad ways of organizing actions or things. (p. 15)

- ==Boundary objects== - Throughout this book, we speak of classifications as objects for cooperation across social worlds, or as boundary objects (Star and Griesemer 1 989). Drawing from earlier studies of interdisciplinary scientific cooperation, we define boundary obj ects as those objects that both inhabit several communities of practice and satisfy the informational requirements of each of them.

- ==Book structure==: 
	- first chapter details key themes of the work
- ==Part 1== - Classification and Large-Scale Infrastructures - look at global medical classification system

For over 100 years ,however, there has never been consensus about disease categories or about the p rocess of collecting data. (p. 19)
- Algorithms for codification do not resolve the moral questions involved, although they may obscure them
- "seemingly neutral data collection" erases the moral debate

- ==Part 2== - looks at two cases where the lives of individuals are broken, twisted and torqued by their enounters with classification systems (p. 26)
	- Chapater 5/6 - biography and classification
- ==Part 3== - how classification systems organize and are organized by work practice 

- **Importance of studying classification systems**

We need a topography of things such as the distribution of ambiguity; the fluid dynamics of how classification systems meet up-a plate tectonics rather than a static geology. (p. 31)
- use object-oriented programming and other areas of comp sci, libary and information sciences
