Day, R. E. (2014). _Indexing it all: The subject in the age of documentation, information, and data_. The MIT Press.

- earlier book - *The Modern Invention of Information: Discourse, History, and Power* - examines information as cultural and soical phenomenon
- *Indexing it all* - continues the investigation - extrapolates, expands and contemporizes the concept of "index" (p. 2)
	- focus on "documentary index" - mode of social positioning 

in this present book encompasses the twentieth- and early twenty-first-century tradition of documentation, information, and data and their sciences (what I call “the modern documentary tradition”) (p. 2)

- Critical "epistemic-historical method" - book examines the notions and uses of indexicality, from documental through informational and into data moments of a documentary "episteme" (p. 2)

The book examines the transition of indexes from being explicit professional structures that mediate the relation of user needs and documentary information in seeking, searching, and retrieving to being implicit infrastructural devices in everyday information and communication acts. (p. 2)
- ==follows the increating representation of individauls and gorups in the forms of documents, information and then 

- Book's approach: examine conceptual cases that cover later modernity from early 20th C to present time - "beginning with documentation’s user-document distinction, and reaching up to the mediation of this relation through the logical tools of information retrieval and social networking, and then to the subsumption of both documents and users as data" (p. 2)
- Hegelian dialetic - three moments of the modern documentary tradition
	- sociotechnical logics of the user-documentation relationship is fundamentally dialectical
- "discourse of 'data'" - conceived as 'fact' has come to supersede the trope of 'information'

[“Hegel's dialectics” refers to the particular dialectical method of argument employed by the 19th Century German philosopher, G.W.F. Hegel (see entry on Hegel), which, like ==other “dialectical” methods, relies on a contradictory process between opposing sides.==]

- Search algos changing from being "obvious professional devices to being transparent or everyday sociocultural or physical codes thorugh which one must pass to gain knowledge and to become an active and mature person in society" (p. 3)
	- interesting use of "transparent" here in the current context
- We live in a world of codes - consciously and unconsciously pass - codes are not only cognitiive but expressed by the body

What Foucault called the “disciplinary society” is now introjected into the foundations of expressions and the body; documentary codes—evidence of our being x or having y knowledge and skills—form the unconscious and so structure our expressions.
- book gives one reading of this journey of consciousness as it is shaped "in its very social and perosnal identity, thorugh documentary tools, forms and infrastructures of expression and meaning" (p. 4)

Link to [[Terranova - Network culture]]
	-hope that the internet represents a platform forsomethingg other than dialectic - emergence of a Deleuzian or Negrian "multitude" or singularities - espace th priority of the notion of hte subejct within Western culture
	- this book is darker

- ==What are docuemnts and are indexes?== (p. 5)
	- document as in library and information sciences
	- in the book, considering document in the "modern documentary tradition to be that of 'evidence'"
		- Documents as evidence are ontological entities (p. 5)

All evidence is evidence of something, and that something belongs to orders of possible evidence for a need (from which the need is formed).

- Signs - p. 6 - Link to [[Langlois - Meaning in the age of social media]]
- Discussion of Ferdinand de Saussure's *langue* - "hypothetical or actual fields of potential meaningful actions through which meaningful speech acts occur. "
Such speech acts are treated in the modern documentary tradition as “self-evident” evidence (once again, using Derridean vocabulary, as auto-affective “presence”). (p. 6)

- Documents are signs that have referential relations to other signs and to forms of life - John Seely Brown/Paul Duguid - =="social life of information"== - "documents do meaningful things because they are meaningful within networks and uses of other meaningful signs (which may be linguistic, physical, visual, or otherwise)"

- ==Indexes== - French librarian/documentalist Suzanne Briet - *indice* to name documentary sign - trans. into English as "sign" but in French, word is *signe* 
	- ==*Indice* is a type of sign - indexical sign"

The difference between a good human-generated index of a book and a bad machine-generated index of a book involves the ability to create an index that positions the first set of references within the meaning and sense of the second. (p. 7)

- Briet - argues for a notion the docuemnt as *indice* - critical expansion of a notion of docuemnt as *evidence*
	- the antelope as a documentary sign - animal becomes named by being placed or indexed within accepted regimes of documentary cultural forms and social norms 

Indice *are socio-technical devices that have technological and social logics enfolded within them as meaningful functions for information organization and use and they give rise to and mediate the social positioning and information and knowledge values of texts and person as documents, information, and data.* (p. 9)

- Briet: Documentation as a cultural technique (p. 9)

*The documentary typology of individuals is a distinguishing characteristic of sociocultural modernity.*
- Briet's argument that documents are "cultural techniques" + necessity for scientific modernity - ==modern documentary tradition constitutes an important modern episteme that defines us both through technical and everyday practices==
	- Book - considers this "new rhythm" of documentary modernity - via mediation of information and communication technologies
- ==Book's central questions==: What are the consequences of this rhythm of the modern documentary tradition and its different moments of development for psychological senses of self, others, and groups? What are the political consequences of this new rhythm and its episteme? How is knowledge and agency being reshaped?

With Briet’s notion of the indice in mind, this book creates a documentary variation of “social positioning theory” (a term used by the philosopher Rom Harré and various of his coauthors) to ask: How do we socially and culturally position ourselves and others by means of documentary technologies and techniques? What are the social and technical roles and rules that govern the positioning of ourselves as documentation, information, and data users and objects? (p. 10)
- five cases over five chapters

Of relevance:
- ==Chapter 5== - The Document as the Subject: Androids
	- Relevant for discussions on AI? 
	- "I discuss the attempt to embody human agency within an information system that appears like a human being."
- ==Chapter 6== - Governing Expression: Social Big Data and Neoliberalism
	- Relevant to data colonialism aspect of my research - In this chapter I discuss the mutual reduction of documentary subjects and objects to being conjoined points of data within systems of social “big data." (p. 12)
	- Link to Hayles - "hyper" or "surface" reading - the skimming or surveillance of texts through documentary means in order to answer information needs.

### Chapter 6 - Governing expression: social big data and neoliberalism
- this chapter goes into the discussion of labour as it transforms into capital 

- Discussion of Marx: concept of persons as labor commodities in markets regulated by exchange value 
- Foucault's read of neoliberalism: 
As Michel Foucault (2008) stressed in his work on neoliberalism, ==contemporary neoliberalism, unlike earlier market liberalism, is not just a celebration of the functions of markets, but rather, neoliberalism stresses competition as the means for the social value of markets==. (p. 125)
- importance of modeling - cleaning abhorrent data

Paul N. Edwards (2010) has wonderfully shown the extent to which global climate science must rely on modeling, which involves not only the “cleansing” of text into data, but the “smoothing” out of aberrant data as well as the smoothing out of differences within and between different data types...Here, “smoothing” is not only performed by researchers in their reconciliation, modeling, and visualization of data, but by the subjects upon other subjects and upon themselves in their expressions and their identity formations. (p. 128)
