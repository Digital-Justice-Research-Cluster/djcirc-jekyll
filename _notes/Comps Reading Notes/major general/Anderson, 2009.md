Warwick Anderson (2009) discusses the place that postcolonialism (as a theory and an onto-epistemological framework) has had/needs in science and technology studies. He laments the distance and divisiveness with which postcolonial studies/theories/methods are described by scholars who, in his opinion, are engaged in work that looks to the postcolonial. This is similar to the claim levelled by [[de Sousa Santos, 2018]] against the 'epistemologies of the North'. He does so by presenting three “case-studies”: 1) STS/actor-network theory (with a focus on the work of Bruno Latour), 2) science studies, 3) science and globalization. He also provides explanations for such a reluctance to situate work as postcolonial. This is especially important since according to [[Merten, 2016]], there has been an unwillingness for scholars from the sciences to embrace #postcolonialism and for those in the humanities to embrace #science. Furthermore, this text is important in the larger context of the major general given that one of the aims of this reading list is to think through ways to decolonize communications and media studies to engender social and cultural change in response to [[Freire, 2000]] and [[Said, 2003]], two scholars who understand the role of knowledge creation  in fostereing/promoting/sustaining certain #epistemologies and #ontologies.

**Relevance to major general**
Provides an overview of the arguments made to avoid engaging with/positioning one’s self as a postcolonial scholar/postcolonial scholarship. Interesting and lively critique that can help situate other texts such as de Sousa Santos’ (2018) The end of the cognitive empire: The coming of age of the epistemologies of the South.
