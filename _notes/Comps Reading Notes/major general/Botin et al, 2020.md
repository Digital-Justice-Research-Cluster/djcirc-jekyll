### Abstract

#majorgeneral #technology #STS #criticaltheory #postphenomenology


In this article introducing their special edition of *Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology*, Botin et al (2020) describe how scholars of critical constructivism and postphenomelogy have understood and discussed the role of technology in society. They provide an overview of the articles discussed in the special issue along with how they relate to the main concerns of both these fields of study when in comes to the philosophy of technology. This introductory article is useful since it provides a quick overview of the main themes and debates one would find at the intersections of #STS, critical theory, and post-phenomenology (which are all subdisciplines that provide some of the theoretical foundation for this field). 

**Relevance to major general**
Provide an overview of the theoretical debates in the philosophy of science, mainly critical constructivism and postphenomenology. (could be helpful in making connections and discussing detailed/specific issues)
