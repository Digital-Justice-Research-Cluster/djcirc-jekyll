Peters (2009) provides an overview of “the idea of communication” and the discourses that have accompanied this idea. Rather than simply providing a historical overview of the use of the word communication (although he provides several definitions/etymologies), or of communication theory/discipline, he proposes a book that focuses on the intermingling of communications varied historical and etymological origins. In doing so, he offers musings that reflect the interdisciplinary nature of communication as a theory, a more of inquiry, an ethical problem, and an academic discipline. 

**Relevance to major general**
Acts as a hinge between different texts and approaches to communication theory/the history of the field. Connects and contextualizes much of the theorists/authors that make up Western communications/media studies. 
	Some issues (similarly in Craig) emerging from the assumption that communications is not a field in itself (hide behind that label when in terms of epistemology and way to understand what is/counts as knowledge there is a trajectory and hard lines between what is in or out, although this is not addressed only implied)
