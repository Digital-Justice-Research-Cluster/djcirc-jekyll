This edited collection brings together scholars working in postcolonial studies and media studies to develop a postcolonial approach to media studies. In doing so, the authors evaluate the usefulness of each field since “literature is still over represented” as the subject of postcolonial studies and “at the same time, the postcolonial approach is still underrepresented in media studies” (7). The book provides both theoretical and applied perspectives to the convergence of postcolonial and media studies. 

**Relevance for major general**
Provides theoretical/historical contextualization for postcolonial and media studies (e.g., the trajectory of German media studies and what a postcolonial approach would bring to the discipline)
