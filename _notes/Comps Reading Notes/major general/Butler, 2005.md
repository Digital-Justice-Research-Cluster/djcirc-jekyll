### Abstract
\```
What does it mean to lead a moral life? In her first extended study of moral philosophy, Judith Butler offers a provocative outline for a new ethical practice-one responsive to the need for critical autonomy and grounded in a new sense of the human subject.Butler takes as her starting point one's ability to answer the questions What have I done?and What ought I to do?She shows that these question can be answered only by asking a prior question, Who is this 'I' who is under an obligation to give an account of itself and to act in certain ways?Because I find that I cannot give an account of myself without accounting for the social conditions under which I emerge, ethical reflection requires a turn to social theory.In three powerfully crafted and lucidly written chapters, Butler demonstrates how difficult it is to give an account of oneself, and how this lack of self-transparency and narratibility is crucial to an ethical understanding of the human. In brilliant dialogue with Adorno, Levinas, Foucault, and other thinkers, she eloquently argues the limits, possibilities, and dangers of contemporary ethical thought.Butler offers a critique of the moral self, arguing that the transparent, rational, and continuous ethical subject is an impossible construct that seeks to deny the specificity of what it is to be human. We can know ourselves only incompletely, and only in relation to a broader social world that has always preceded us and already shaped us in ways we cannot grasp. If inevitably we are partially opaque to ourselves, how can giving an account of ourselves define the ethical act? And doesn't an ethical system that holds us impossibly accountable for full self-knowledge and self-consistency inflict a kind of psychic violence, leading to a culture of self-beratement and cruelty? How does the turn to social theory offer us a chance to understand the specifically social character of our own unknowingness about ourselves?In this invaluable book, by recasting ethics as a project in which being ethical means becoming critical of norms under which we are asked to act, but which we can never fully choose, Butler illuminates what it means for us as fallible creaturesto create and share an ethics of vulnerability, humility, and ethical responsiveness. Judtith Butler is the Maxine Elliot Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley. The most recent of her books are Precarious Life: The Power of Mourning and Violence and Undoing Gender.

Through this metaphor of 'giving an account', Butler (2005) elucidates the role of subjectivation in continental philosophy (and psychoanalysis). She asks the question: is it possible to give an account of oneself and what does that entail? In doing so, she asks how do we come to know ourselves as people (and why does that happen through our awareness of the Other)? Although seemingly unrelated to communications & media studies, this text reveals some of the phiisophical roots of continental theory (which in turn gave way to more specific disciplines such as communication studies and media studies). Her work works well in tandem with  scholars such as [[Deleuze, 1997]], [[Derrida, 2013]], [[Glowczewski, 2020]], [[Heidegger, 1977]], and many more since at the core of these texts are debates and questions about the nature of being (as a way to distinguish between human and animal through a study of communication and media). Accordingly, this work echoes and reverberates through [[Kittler, 1996]], [[McLuhan, 2013]], [[Sharma et al, 2014]], [[Towns, 2022]], and many others even if these writers wrote before Butler or in different disciplines. At the core of  these practices is a desire to understand one's self as a 'subject' and/or an 'actor', this text provides a foundation through which the rest of the #majorgeneral field can be positioned and interpreted (even as far as texts like [[de Sousa Santos, 2018]] or [[Hui, 2017]]).


**Chapter 1** 

- Useful critique of subjectivity/subjectivation/the subject in continental philosophy which is adopted by communications scholars. link to Craig (communications theory not as a field but as theoretical amalgamations).

	Transition piece from continental philosophy to pluriversal philosophy? 

- Contextualizing ‘transindividuation’ (Stiegler) and psychic/collective individuation (Simondon) into a larger philosophical discussion on subjectivation. presents a dilemma that animates continental philosophy/psychoanalysis

**Chapter 2** 

- The ethical project/conditions under which one can give an account; tracing the limits (how can subjectivation be limiting?) Subjectivation as an ethical project. subjectivity as an attempt to give an account= modes of subjectivation are ways we come to know ourselves (think about short circuit, what does that produce, potentially?) 

	Communication as subjectivation: complicated by questions of a diasporic unconscious 

- Subjectivation (the giving of the account) as an inherently social practice; the conditions of ‘becoming’ are presupposed and the address represents an attempt to recover to conditions (that make our becoming possible; prehistory)–dilemma emerges because that recovery (fully achieved) is an impossible task 

**Relevance to major general**
Provides useful critiques of continental philosophy as well as psychoanalysis. can act as a transition piece between ideas, hinges on different authors/theoretical contributions from similar fields but that require some putting together. can also act as an example that putting together (a method), which can also justify why the major general was designated/designed the way it was
