### Abstract

### Notes
In <i>The Question Concerning Technology</i>, Martin Heidegger attempts to describe the “essence” of technology. In doing so, he differentiates himself from other communications/technology studies scholars (mainly American/British/French schools of thought) in approaching/understanding technology as a force which not only extends human capacity (i.e.: McLuhan) but as a major organizer of humanity. In doing so, he proposes technology as a mode of enframing (<i>Gestell</i>) which has become ubiquitous in studies of technology. 

relevance for major general: essential/foundational text, the concepts of <i>Gestell</i> and <i>poeisis</i> are central to communications/media/technology studies curriculum and continue to influence those fields today.
