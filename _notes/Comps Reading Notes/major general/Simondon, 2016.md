### Abstract
\```
For Gilbert Simondon, the human/machine distinction is perhaps not a simple dichotomy and there is much to learn from technical objects. He takes up the task of a true thinker who sees the potential for humanity to uncover life-affirming modes of technical objects whereby we can discover potentiality for novel, healthful, and dis-alienating rapports with them.
