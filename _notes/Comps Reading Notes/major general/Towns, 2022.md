### Abstract
\```
Who is the human in media philosophy? Although media philosophers have argued since the twentieth century that media are fundamental to being human, this question has not been explicitly asked and answered in the field. Armond R. Towns demonstrates that humanity in media philosophy has implicitly referred to a social Darwinian understanding of the human as a Western, white, male, capitalist figure. Building on concepts from Black studies and cultural studies, Towns develops an insightful critique of this dominant conception of the human in media philosophy and introduces a foundation for Black media philosophy. Delving into the narratives of the Underground Railroad, the politics of the Black Panther Party, and the digitization of Michael Brown’s killing, On Black Media Philosophy deftly illustrates that media are not only important for Western Humanity but central to alternative Black epistemologies and other ways of being human.

In <i>On Black Media Philosophy</i>, Towns argues for a Black media philosophy. This media philosophy aims to extend and reinterpret already existing media theory, namely that of Marshall McLuhan, and to recover a reading of media philosophy that extricates the Negro from the objectifying narrative of continental/Western media philosophy. He does so by showcasing how Black people have and continue to re-imagine ourselves and our belonging in mediated ways that escape the purview of whiteness (as an enterprise). This allows him to position Huey P. Newton as a media philosopher and analyse his theory of “intercommunalism” as a media theory. 

relevance for major general: extension/critique of McLuhan’s media theory. Doing what de Sousa Santos call forrh as non-abyssal theory/sociology of absences. Showcases the importance of McLuhan’s work and his influence on other scholars, how that work can be reappropriated/understood for “decolonial” goals
