In <i>The History of Communication Media</i>, Kittler provides a historical overview of what he calls “the scientific history of media”. In doing so, he highlights the relationship between communication (as a practice and a field of inquiry), media, and technologies come about as the result of historically progressive transformations from cultural practice and scientific phenomena/discovery to technological objects. His overview covers writing and printing, as well as telegraphy and analog technology (under the umbrella: technical media) and digital technology. 

**Relevance to major general**
Provide a historical scientific/technical history of media and technology. Can be slotted into other texts on the history of communications (as a field) and of technical media that might be discussed therein
