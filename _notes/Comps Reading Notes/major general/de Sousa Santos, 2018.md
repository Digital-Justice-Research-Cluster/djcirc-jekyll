In this book, de Sousa Santos proposes the 'epistemologies of the South' which "concern the production and validation of knowledges anchored in the experiences of resistance of all those social groups that have systematically suffered injustice, oppression, and destruction caused by capitalism, colonialism, and patriarchy" (1). He contends that this epistemology is necessary since the dominant (or hegemonic) mode of thinking (identified as the epistemologies of the North) rely on the "abyssal line" which is defined by "an ontological capitis diminutio for not being fully human" (23) on the part of those on *this* side of the abyssal line. As a form of exclusion, abyssal exclusions deny whoever is excluded of their potential to become fully human. If his analogy holds true then, we can observe this *ontological capitis diminutio* (or the belief that it plagues) in certain groups (women, racialized/colonized people, poor people, disabled people, non-heterosexual or cisgender people, etc). This is significant since, according to de Sousa Santos, this fully capacity for humanity is what is believed to have trust 'western societies' forward in the development of philosophy, science, capitalism, democracy, and other social-politico-philosophical frameworks that come to animate and sustain societies. In making abyssal exclusions visible, he makes the case for the recovery of these forgotten epistemologies. He argues that it is necessary to recover "what does not even as knowledge in the light of the dominant epistemologies" (2) since these frameworks work, in part, by exposing abyssal exclusions. In doing so, the necessity for these epistemologies necesarilly comes to the fore. As the crises of capitalism, (neo)colonialism, and heteropatriarchy come to a head, recovering the epistemologies of the South is necesarry in building/imagining new worlds. 

**Relevance for major general**
This text provides an ethical and onto-epistemological justification for the 'decolonization' of communications and media studies (this includes cultural studies). de Sousa Santos' writing on the necessity to eappropriate different ways of thinking is also echoed in the work of [[de la Cadena, 2018]], [[de la Cadena, 2015]], [[Escobar, 2018]], [[Glowczewski, 2020]], [[Harding, 2011]], [[Freire, 2000]], [[Towns, 2022]], and many others who are included in the reading list developped for the major general field. A section of the texts which comprise the reading list for this field, while they are not necesarilly directly related to communications or media studies theory, provide a foundation for thinking about the establishing of communications (media and cultural studies) as a field of inquiry.
