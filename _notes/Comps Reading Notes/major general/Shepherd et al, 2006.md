### Abstract
\```
"In Communication as ...: Perspectives on Theory, editors Gregory J. Shepherd, Jeffrey St. John, and Ted Striphas bring together a collection of 27 essays that explores the wide range of theorizing about communication, cutting across all lines of traditional divisions in the field." "The essays in this text are written by leading scholars in the field of communication theory, with each scholar employing a particular stance or perspective on what communication theory is and how it functions. In essays that are brief, argumentative, and forceful, the scholars propose their perspective as a primary or essential way of viewing communication with decided benefits over other views."–BOOK JACKET.

### Notes
This edited collection brings together which introduce readers (and communication/media studies scholars) to the theoretical debates that have and continue to animate the “field” of communications. Each chapter provides a different understanding of what communications is, what communications scholars do, and how communications should orient itself. While the book presents communications theory/history from a Western perspective, the authors move from micro to macro issues relevant to the field. 

Relevance to major general: Similar to Craig (1999) and Waisboard (2019) in providing an overview of the disciplines that fall under the umbrella of communications, media studies, cultural studies, STS, media anthropology (which make up the larger field of communications).
