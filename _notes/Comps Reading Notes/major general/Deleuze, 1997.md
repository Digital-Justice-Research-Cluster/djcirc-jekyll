In this short text, Deleuze define/describes the concept of immanence within the umbrella of philosophy of life (i.e.: Spinoza, etc). He describes how the post structuralist subject which becomes increasingly important in the philosophy of communications (move away from modernist thinking, wanting to push the boundaries of that framework) during/after the post structuralist turn. This connects him to [[Botin et al, 2020]] as well as [[Butler, 2005]] and situate them within philosophy at large. Although this text doesn't necesarilly deal with communications itself, like [[Butler, 2005]] or [[Derrida, 2013]], this philosophical foundation is necesary if we wish to understand the impetus for the study of communications which through [[Heidegger, 1977]] we learn has some origins in Greek philisophe (i.e. techne) & from [[Kittler, 1996]] that there is a long history of the study of media and communication (and of what those terms designate as well).


**Relevance for major general**
Helps make sense of the ‘return to philosophy’ experienced in communications theory (and social theory at large), also works as a bridge from [[Heidegger, 1977]]
(and his larger philosophy) and exemplifies the limits of critical social theory identified by [[de Sousa Santos, 2018]] (abyssal thinking).
