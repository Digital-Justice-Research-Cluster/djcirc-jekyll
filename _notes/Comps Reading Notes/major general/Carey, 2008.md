In this book, Carey proposes an approach to communications that “broadens the definition (of communication) to include the drawing together of a people that is culture”. In doing so, he allows for the development of a uniquely American ‘cultural studies’ (a terms he uses to define a part of the proseminar he attended early in his tenure). As his work is deeply influenced by Marshall McLuhan ([[McLuhan, 2013]]) and Harold Innis (he wrote a dissertation about McLuhan and Innis and engages deeply with their work), he focuses on the social process of communication (rather than simply focusing on the mechanical/technological process as the be all end all of communications and media). Rather than contradicting [[Craig, 1999]] in his assertion that communications is not a field, he demonstrates how through its inherent interdisciplinarity, communication theory come to coalesce into a somewhat coherent whole. Furthermore, his deeply North-American approach to communications (focusing on technology and cultural practices rather than grand theory and/or philosophy) helps distinguish between North-American and European/continental communications theory. Something that [[Kittler, 1996]] also does in his historical overview of media and communications.


**Relevance to major general**
Connection with [[McLuhan, 2013]] (in proposing a North-American approach to media studies) also connects to [[Sharma et al, 2014]] & [[Towns, 2022]] and their reinterpretations of his work
