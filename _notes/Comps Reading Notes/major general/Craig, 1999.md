Craig argues that communications theory is not a field (in terms of coherence) but that there exists enough lines of flight to connect it as such. With this in mind, he proposes 7 traditions that could make up the field we know as communications theory. Given that this paper was written and published during the 1990â€™s his perspective is interesting since communications is now treated as a field of inquiry in and of itself. Craig (1999) provides a refreshing looks into the history of a discipline in its becoming. While some of the fields identified by Craig have collapsed or been absorbed into other sub-disciplines, his description of these traditions is grounded in a deep understanding of the theoretical and methodological perspectives that had influenced communications up to this point. 

**Relevance to major general**
Provides a skeleton of the theoretical traditions that animate the field and disrupts the idea that communications is and has always been a unified field of inquiry. Connects him to people like [[Carey, 2008]] , [[Kittler, 1996]], [[McLuhan, 2013]]  and [[Peters, 2000]] who have attempted to trace the lineage of what we now understand to be the field of communications, media studies and cultural studies.
