### Abstract
\```
"Communication studies is a fragmented field. As a result of its roots in various disciplinary traditions, it is built on fluid intellectual boundaries. Should we worry about this state of dispersion? Waisbord argues that it isimpossible to transcend fragmentation, but communication studies is better served by accepting and stimulating differences"â€“

In his book, Silvio Waisboard describes the epistemic traditions of the many disciplines that have converged around the issue of communication. In weaving this cross-disciplinary history, he argues that communications is not ( and has never been) a field. Rather, he classifies communications as a post-discipline (characterized by an embrace of multidisciplinary research/contributions, little to no disciplinary boundaries and ambivalence towards essentializing debates). This, he argues, is the true strength of communications research and should be embraced more readily (shows that communication has a vast epistemic/theoretical provenance and an even larger reach). 

**Relevance for major general**
Builds on [[Craig, 1999]], provides a theoretical overview of the major concerns/roots of the field. shows the epistemological/ontological coherence of continental/western/abyssal (de Sousa Santos) research (this is useful in making the case that communications is an abyssal discipline and identifying a way forward for a non-abyssal communications theory)
