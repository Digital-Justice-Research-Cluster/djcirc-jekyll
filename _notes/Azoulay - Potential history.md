Azoulay, A. A. (2019). _Potential history: Unlearning Imperialism_. Verso Books.

- Looting of artifacts by "imperial agents", passed as "precious art objects"
	- The camera shutter's role in imperial acquisition
		- "imperial premises of photography" - Arago - p. 22 - confirmed by Walter Benjamin - Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction

In a split second, the camera’s shutter draws ==three dividing lines:== in time (between a before and an after), in space (between who/what is in
front of the camera and who/what is behind it), and in the body politic (between those who possess and operate such devices and appropriate
and accumulate their product and those whose countenance, resources, or labor are extracted). (p. 24)
- the "imperial" shutter
- "grasping its particular brefvity and the spectrum of its rapidity"

- ==Unlearning imperialism== - p. 26

Unlearning imperialism aims at unlearning its origins, found in the repetitive moments of the operation of imperial shutters. ==Unlearning imperialism refuses the stories the shutter tells.==
- how the commons is to be exploited, what can be extracted and the circumstances (p. 26)

- *how does this relate to extractive practices of our data as oil?*
- *how does this relate to the "shutter" of SM giants?*

One may also imagine that those who have been dispossessed manage to recover some of the objects robbed from them or burn the papers that granted their possessions to others. This is not what one has to work hard to imagine; this happens anyway. Rather, it needs to be recognized and acknowledged as an intrinsic part of the shutter’s operation. There is always withdrawal or refusal. 

- ==Unlearning imperialism==:

This is what unlearning imperialism looks like. It means unlearning the dissociation that unleashed an unstoppable movement of (forced) migration of objects and people in different circuits and the destruction of the worlds of which they were part. ==These worlds were transformed into a construction site where everything could be made into raw material.== 
- attempt to suspend the operation of the shutter and resist its operation in tiem, space, and the body politic (p. 27)
- the imperfect role of restitution as per Glen Coulthard (p. 27)

- ==book's method==: rehearsals 

This book is the outcome of research conducted through ==a series of “rehearsals” in returning to the time imperial shutters clicked open and
closed,== in joining strikes and imagining possible strikes across archives involving old and new alliances between professional and nonprofessional users of cameras and archives, shareholders of their accumulated wealth.

==Potential history== does not mend worlds after violence but rewinds to the moment before the violence occurred and sets off from there. (p. 29)
- unlearning imperialism means an end to the "neutrality" of its devices - ie. the camera
- necessary to disengage from "unquestioning use" of terms like citizen, archive, art, sovereignty, human rights - and ==new and neutral==

- Author's act in holding on to her name - Aisha - as an "attempt to hold on to the potential preserved in it" (p. 33)
- "unlearning with companions" 

Political ontology, as this book recovers it, is predicated on the rejection of imperial taxonomies that generate discrete beings defined by their discrete ontology.
- ==cocitizenship== - "unlearning with companions"

Imperial citizenship needs a past. The role of institutions such as archives and museums in the “preservation” of the past is the effect of a vast enterprise of destruction conducted at the expense of and as a substitute for destroyed worlds. (p. 38)
- Hannah Arendt's *wordlessness* - p. 38

Worldlessness is often used to describe the state of people who were left with no world to dwell in. 

- ==Progress== as a destructive force

The movement of progress, as Hannah Arendt argued in *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, is a mode of terror: “This movement, proceeding according to its own law, cannot in the long run be hindered; eventually its force will always prove more powerful than the most powerful forces engendered by the actions and the will of men." (p. 38-39)
- progress and the Foucault's panopticon - p. 40 - Simone Browne's slave ship 
- pursuit of the "new" - "new heights"

Progress, as Foucault refers to it here, is not a philosophical idea but rather a force that by the eighteenth century was acknowledged as something that could not and should not be stopped. (p. 40)

The pursuit of the *new* plays a crucial role in enabling imperial violence to be experienced and perceived as a given condition, irreversible. (p. 41)

- ==two axes of combined history== - Similarly, accounts of art, archives, or architecture in Congo in the beginning of the twentieth century, or in Palestine in the late 1940s, should refrain from relating to them as completely looted or destroyed, and from reiterating the imperial judgments of experts who state that the “best samples” of non-Western material culture are already in the possession of Western institutions, and the rest of it is fake. (p. 46)
- shifts *worldlessness* from association with state of the enslaved/refugess to ==the imperial enterprise and to study the ways that imperial practices, institutions, and legal, political, and cultural languages deny groups' incessant engagement with the wirld as a way of racializing and thus depriving them of their share in different common woirlds== (p. 46)

**The human condition**
- Western museums established on "democratization" - promise that citizens enjoy common wealth - implies that citizens' rights are anchored to objects deposited in public institutions
	- extraction of material wealth of others to ensure the rights of privileged citizens
- human condition = historical condition, arising from and against unstoppable imperial movement

*Potential History* continues Arendt’s endeavor in *The Human Condition*, while taking up Audre Lorde’s call not to use the master’s
tools, “for the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house,” and employing Sylvia Wynter’s framework of the diverse human species
that the master’s framework—Man—occludes.

- Arendt anchors the human condition in labor, work, and action (p. 50)
- Relevant to data colonialism? "Unlearning the archive" (p. 58)

Unlearning the archive as a place is instrumental in joining others who resisted against it in claiming that not everything should be archivable and that not all forms of relationship should be mediated by the archive. (p. 58)
- question of neutrality: 

==Chapter 2== - I pay special attention to the standardized procedures for treating art objects and archival documents—collecting, salvaging, cataloguing, preserving, and studying critically—==and read experts’ claims to neutrality with regard to the objects as a violent destruction of meaning==. (p. 58)

The establishment of the archive as a neutral technology and state institution made it a model that the governed could use and other state apparatuses could imitate and adapt. ==The institutionalization of neutrality, as a model and at the same time as a technology of progress, enabled its accelerated propagation across very different contexts.==
- transfer of imperial archives from colonies to Europe could be pursued not as a spectacle of looting but of fact
	- 'just there'-ness of an archive == just there-ness of our data - Link to [[Dignazio and Klein - Data feminism]]
	- guise of "neutrality" perpetuates the continuation of the imperial archive
	- violence of the archive - p. 59

**Potential history**
Potential history is a form of being with others, both living and dead, across time, against the separation of the past from the present, colonized peoples from their worlds and possessions, and history from politics. (p. 60)
- the need for "rehearsals of disengagement from the frenetic pursuit of the new" - crucial in avoiding the imperial temporality that asks us to seek new solutions for a better future
- role of de Saussure signs and semiotics - p. 62

By reconstructing imperial sovereignty as an apparatus of violence that eradicates alternatives and disperses the many who get together to expose and resist state violence, I will foreground other political formations in which people act as members of a shared world they are engaged in preserving, rather than acting as spokespersons for those institutions and formations to which they are enlisted and which they are required to represent. (p. 63)

==Chapter 5== - discussion on "worldly sovereignty" - I reconstruct its slow and violent imposition from within and outside the archive, tracing the elimination of other options essential to the triumph of differential sovereignty.

- ==Citizen-perpetrators== - "socializing people into taking differential rule for granted" (p. 65) - ordinary people, doing crimes 

The perpetrator is not conceived here as an aggrandized persona, but rather as an ordinary man or woman, a citizen-perpetrator, whose actions seem ordinary to herself or himself. (p. 66)

Being a citizen means taking part in imperial enterprises, participating in their crimes, and acting on their behalf without crossing a threshold where a decision of whether to collaborate in this or that abusive project needs be made. (p. 66)

- ==regime-made disasters== - Regime-made disasters are disasters that are generated and reproduced by the structure of a regime based on differential rule.

- the role of ==rights== - protocols

Rights are reconsidered in this book as protocols for a shared world, an alternative configuration to the dominant discourse of human rights that is conceived and considered from the perspective of differential sovereign powers and emblematized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
- building of common worlds - even while enslaved

- Resistance in restoration of "a different promise" - ==the promise of saying *no* to progress. *No, this is not possible* is the cry people utter everywhere against those who acted as though nothing should limit them.== (p. 72)
	- As opposed to the "slogan" of imperialism - "nothing is impossible"
		- i.e. Sky's the limit!

To counter the imperial promise of a new beginning promoted through the threedimensional imperial principle that constantly threatens the commons, ==this book is tuned to a different modality: that of rehearsal, reversal, rewinding, repairing, renewing, reacquiring, redistributing, readjusting, reallocating, and on and on.== (p. 72)
- institutional, procedural violence of imperialism - not just constituent violence
