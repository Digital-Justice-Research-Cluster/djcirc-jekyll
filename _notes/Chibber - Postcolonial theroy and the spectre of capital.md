Chibber, V. (2013). _Postcolonial theory and the spectre of capital_. Verso.

- point of origin of post-colonial studies - literary and cultural studeis 
	- "migrated byeond literary analysis"
- also claimed to not just study colonial history but also to enable political practice 

Postcolonial studies has thus positioned itself not only as positive theory but also as radical critique. (p. 2)

- scholars: Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Homi Bhabha, Ranajit Guha, Anibal Quijano, Partha Chatterjee, and Dipesh Chakrabarty emerged from the Marxist milieu of the 1970s
- challenge of postcolonial studies: 

As a result, the challenge faced by postcolonial studies is strikingly similar to the one accepted by Marxism a century ago—to generate a theory adequate to the needs of a radical political agenda.
- critics: success of the field raises "formidable challenges to a proper assessment"
- *post*-theory - more an "intellectual orientation than as a theory"
- conceptual inflation (p. 3)
- Marxism vs postcolonial studies:

The difference is that Marxism always sought internal coherence and systematicity, while postcolonial studies resists any compulsion to bring together and assess its various strands.

- ==Book's central concern== - examine the framework that postcolonial studies has generated for *historical analysis* + the analysis of what once was called the Third World (p. 5)

#### Subaltern studies
- Subaltern Studies project - concieved by Ranjit Guha - historian of modern india - in this comps list - Spivak 
- "history from below" - New Left (p. 6)

While the group internalized the turn toward popular movements and culture that was then pervading historical scholarship, it also took on board another set of concerns, of a more local character. ==These had to do with the trajectory of colonial and postcolonial India as set against the wider experience of global modernity.== (p. 6)
- Subcontinent's political evolution since Independence

- departure from ==cultural Marxism== to ==poststructuralist agenda== - Spivak's "Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography" - shift to Foucault and Derrida 
	- suspicious of scientific thought, rationalism, and Enlightenment - Chatterjee

The turn toward a recognizably poststructuralist orientation certainly ensured the projects attractiveness outside the narrow circle of Marxist historians of South Asia. (p. 8)

...Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, who parachuted into the project in 1985 with her essay in the fourth volume. Even more significant was the publication, in 1987, of Selected Subaltern Studies, which included a foreword, and hence endorsement, by Edward Said, an imposing presence on the intellectual scene by the late 1980s whose 1978 book Orientalism had already become a modern classic.
- "lurking" narrative of political and eocnomic modernization

- Good overview of rise and spread of capitalism from the Continent (p. 10-11)
	- The "conventional story" - England and France, rise of bourgeoisie, response to feudalism

Colonialism would serve as the hand maiden of historical progress; if anything, it would enable an acceleration of the dynamic, as the European bourgeoisie would use the levers of state power to hasten the modernization of the local economy. (pl 12)

- "Subatlern studies response" - (p. 12-17)
	- Six Theses - Eurocentrism (thesis 6)

Thesis 6, the final thesis summarized above, regarding the Eurocentrism of Western theories, is not only a well-known element of the postcolonial canon but perhaps its most famous.

- ==Book's goals:==

One intended contribution of the present book is an analysis of these more foundational elements of the Subaltern Studies project and, by extension, the wider gamut of postcolonial studies. Here the primary focus will be the Subalternists historical sociology, particularly their understanding of the East-West divergence—a subject crucial to their project, albeit one that has garnered very little attention. But I will also address more theoretical matters that have rarely been scrutinized in depth, and more rarely still in tandem with their broader historical claims. (p. 22)

- ==Faiilure of subaltern studies==
	- "Main thrust" is to stress the difference - "inabiltiy to appreciate the fact that capitalism in the East turned out to have fundamentally different properties than did capitalism in the West" (p. 22)
	- three domains that stress the fundamental divide (p. 22):
		1. The first is in the nature of the bourgeoisie: the Western bourgeoisie carried forth capitals universalizing drive while its descendant in the East did not.
		2. Second, the *power relations* produced by Western capitalism were unlike the power relations capitalism generated elsewhere.
		3. Third comes the question of *political psychology*: political actors are motivated by a different set of concerns in the East than they are in the West.

Chibber - I will argue that the claims for a fundamental difference with regard to capital, power, and agency are all irredeemably flawed. (p. 22)
- ==Chapter 2 - 4== - bourgeosie
- ==Chapters 5 and 6== - power [Read this]
- ==Chapter 7 and 8== - political psychology
- ==Chapter 9== - Chakrabarty's arguments about historicism
- ==Concludes== - Chatterjee's theory of colonial nationalism

The main thrust of the book, then, is to elucidate the failure of the arguments from difference, so central to postcolonial theory. (p. 22)
- goes into *The Explantory Failure* (p. 24) 

Subaltern Studies fails as an explanatory framework because it systematically misrepresents the relationship between capitalism and modernity, both in the East and in the West.

- goes into *The Critical Failure*

... one cannot adequately criticize a social phenomenon if one systematically misunderstands how it works. (p. 25)
The more obvious failing on the critical front is that, far from landing a blow *against* colonialist and Orientalist presentations of the East, Subaltern Studies has ended up *promoting* them. (p. 26)
