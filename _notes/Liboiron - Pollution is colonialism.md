Liboiron, M. (2021). _Pollution is colonialism_. Duke University Press.

- Footnote: Since a main goal of *Pollution Is Colonialism* is to ==show how methodology is a way of being in the world and that ways of being are tied up in obligation==, these footnotes are one way to enact that argument. (p. 1)
- Streeter-Phelps equation - the moment that pollution could be measured:

The Streeter-Phelps equation, as it came to be known, not only became a hallmark of water pollution science and regulation but also contained within it their theory of pollution: ==that a moment existed when water could not purify itself and that moment could be measured, predicted, and properly called pollution==.

- linkages between pollution and colonialism:
I mean the bad relations of a scientific theory that allows some amount of pollution to occur and its accompanying entitlement to Land to assimilate that pollution. I mean colonialism. (p. 5)
- colonial land relations

- ==Colonialism== - many people understand colonialism in a monolithic way and "Other people have nuanced understandings of colonialism and seek ways to deal with colonial structures in their everyday lives and research, often in spaces like the academy that reproduce colonialism in uneven ways." (p. 6)
- Book makes three main arguments:
	1. First, pollution is not a manifestation or side effect of colonialism but is rather an **==enactment of ongoing colonial relations to Land==**.
		- colonial relations are reproduced thorugh even well-intentioned environmental science and activism
	2. Second, **==there are ways to do pollution action, particularly environmental science, through different Land relations, and they’re already happening without waiting for the decolonial horizon to appear==**.
	3. Third, I show how **==methodologies== — whether scientific, writerly, readerly, or otherwise — are always already part of Land relations and thus are a key site in which to enact good relations** (sometimes called ethics).

- The use of plastics in the book to refute and refuse the colonial "in a good way" (p. 7)

### Colonialism
- Access to Indigenous land = disposability of plastics - "infrastructural access"
	- regardless of the motivation, net effect is colonialism as is the case with Phelps (environmentalist whose work depended on access to Land - p. 9)

Whether motivated by profit and growth or environmental conservation, both approaches to waste and wasting are premised on an assumed entitlement to Indigenous Land. (p. 9)
- points to different types of colonialism - "settler colonialism, extractive colonialism, internal colonialism, external colonialism, neoimperialism" (p. 9) - some things in common
- points to Coulthard:

==Colonialism is a way to describe relationships characterized by conquest and genocide== that grant colonialists and settlers “ongoing state access to land and resources that contradictorily provide the material and spiritual sustenance of Indigenous societies on the one hand, and the foundation of colonial state-formation, settlement, and capitalist development on the other.” 

- And Edward Said - p. 9-10

- Distinction between ==colonialism== and Western culture:

Western culture certainly has its imperialistic and colonial impulses, histories, and ideas of what is good and right, but these are different things from colonialism...==Colonialism, first, foremost, and always, is about *Land*,== including the circumvention of ethics paper work so researchers can have unfettered and unaccountable access to field sites (a.k.a. homelands), archives, samples, and data. (p. 10)

- Author's claim: Environmentalism does not usually address colonialism and often reproduces it.  
- Colonial land relations as "common sense, even as good ideas"
	- tie to Foucault - "articulation of power as regimes of truth" - some things make sense, to circulate, and to act as truth, while others do not (footnote, p. 12)
		- Link to [[Murphy - The economization of life]] - However, following Michelle Murphy (Métis), I build on this work “unfaithfully,” as “Foucault’s own work on neoliberal economics refuses to engage with colonial and postcolonial histories, the elaboration of the racial state, and drops sex as a central analytic. (Murphy, p. 149)
- ==Capitalism and colonialism== - not the same thing
	- Marx - argues that primitive accumulation (the stealing of land) is foundational to the possibility of capitalism — it’s how someone gets more capital than someone else in the first place, which you need to jump-start a system where only a few people own the means of production. (p. 13)
		- cannot "make and hoard capital without stealing Land first" 
		- Trifecta of capitalism, colonialism, and pollution
- Colonial quests for Land different than capitalist goals for capital - ==more important for understanding the relationship between capitalism and colonialism is that many different economic systems depend on access to Indigenous Land.==
	- Marxists and capitalists view land natural resources as commodities to be exploited - for capitalists for personal gain, for Marxists for the good of all
		- Eve Tuck and Wayne Yang - “Socialist and communist empires have also been settler empires (e.g., Chinese colonialism in Tibet).”


Because of this nuance and its repercussions for political action, political scientist Glen Coulthard (Yellowknives Dene) has called for scholars to shift their analysis away from capitalist relations (production, proletarianization) to colonial relations (dispossession, Land acquisition, access to Land)... (p. 14)

For thinkers such as Tuck and Yang, the “homogenization of various experiences of oppression as colonialism” — that is, conflating imperialism, racism, capitalism, exclusion, and general bad behaviour with colonialism — accomplishes “a form of enclosure, dangerous in how it domesticates decolonization. It is also a foreclosure, limiting in how it recapitulates dominant theories of social change. (p. 15)

- Author's main point: 

Pollution, scientific ways to know pollution, and actions to mitigate pollution are not examples of, symptoms or metaphors for, or unintentional by-products of colonialism, but rather are essential parts of the interlocking logics (brain), mechanisms (hands and teeth), and structures (heart and bones) of colonialism that ==allow colonialism to produce and reproduce its effects in Canada, the United States, and beyond==. (p. 15-16)
- Stealing Land/dispossessing people - requires "maintenance and infrastructure" - the bones of colonialism 
	- footnotes on Sandy Grande - underpinning beliefs that underpin colonial societies

Colonialism is a set of specific, structured, interlocking, and overlapping relations that allow these events to occur, make sense, and even seem right (to some).

These core beliefs are as follows: (1) belief in progress
as change and change as progress; (2) belief in the effective separateness of faith and reason;
(3) belief in the essential quality of the universe and of “reality” as impersonal, secular,
material, mechanistic, and relativistic; (4) subscription to ontological individualism; and
(5) belief in human beings as separate from and superior to the rest of nature. While this text
focuses on the third and fifth beliefs, and particularly how they manifest in pollution science,
all five are part of how land is understood and related to.
(p. 16)

- Dicussion of the origin of the word ==pollution== = mid-14th century, discharge during sex - Though it wasn’t until 1860 that the term pollution was recorded in the sense of environmental contamination 
- Dicussion of Michelle Murphy's concept of the "_alterlife_"

“words, protocols, and methods that might honor the inseparability of bodies and land, and at the same time grapple with the expansive chemical relations of settler colonialism that entangle life forms in each other’s accumulations, conditions, possibilities, and miseries."

- ==Science as reproducting the doctrine of discovery== 

There is no terra nullius for this work. Western science has long been identified as a practice that assumes mastery over Nature, reproduces the doctrine of discovery, revels in exploration and appropriation of Indigenous Land, and is invested in a rigorous self-portraiture in which valid scientific knowledge is created only by proper European subjects.

...science is always already fucked up, which means that our work is always compromised (a concept I explain more in chapter 3) (p. 21)

### What research isn't fucked up?
- How to do research in a compromised terrain? ==This is what I aim to do==

- Author talks of the "We" - Humans are inherently greedy, or wasteful, or addicted to convenience, or naturally self-maximizing, and are downright tragic when it comes to “the” commons.
	- need for specificity of relations - solidarity in We
	- "standing with" - Kim TallBear (STS)

### Decolonialism and Anticolonialism (p. 26)
- CLEAR (Liboiron's lab) as an anticolonial lab
- Tuck and Yang - decolonialism doesn't have a synonym

They write that decolonization means “repatriating land to sovereign Native tribes and nations, abolition of slavery in its contemporary forms, and the dismantling of the imperial metropole. . . . Decolonization is not equivocal to other anti-colonial struggles.” (p. 26)

- Decolonize in the academy - Link to [[Bhambra et al - Decolonizing the university]] - "my dedication to this meaning comes largely from being an academic, where the verb decolonize is frequently invoked as something that you do to university courses, syllabi,101 panels, and other academic nouns." (p. 26)
- ==appropriation of the word like survivance and resurgence is colonial== - 

I hope you can see the relationship of such a promiscuous use of decolonization with the definition of colonialism above: it means settler and colonial access to Indigenous Land, concepts (like decolonization and indigenization), and lifeworlds to advance settler and colonial goals, even if they are benevolent ones. (p. 26)
- indigenous science - *Braiding Sweetgrass* - Kimmerer

An anticolonial lab does not foreground settler and colonial goals. There are many ways to do anticolonial science: in addition to Indigenous sciences, there are, for example, also queer, feminist, Afro-futurist, and spiritual land relations that are anticolonial. ==*Anticolonial* here is meant to describe the diversity of work, positionalities, and obligations that let us “stand with” one another as we pursue good land relations, broadly defined.== (p. 27)

- Author addresses text's obligations and relations (p. 28)
- Methodology of the text - A Road Map - p. 36 - There are colonial ways to be in the world, whether intentionally or otherwise, and there are less colonial and anticolonial ways to be in the world.
	- I use plastics and their status as a pollutant to investigate and then refute those colonial relations. (p. 36)
- Book's chapters:
	- The first chapter, “Land, Nature, Resource, Property,” outlines the historical and conceptual groundwork for the invention of modern environmental pollution as a colonial achievement.
	- The second chapter, “Scale, Harm, Violence, Land,” builds out plastics as more than a monolithic pollutant that must be banned or eradicated, not as a theoretical exercise, but for the purpose of working with plastics in science and activism. 
	- The third and final chapter, “An Anticolonial Pollution Science,” ==lays out the how of clear’s anticolonial science via our methods.== [Read this chapter]
