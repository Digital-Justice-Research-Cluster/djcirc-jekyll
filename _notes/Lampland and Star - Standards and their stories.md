Lampland, M., & Star, S.L. (2009). _Standards and their stories: How quantifying, classifying, and formalizing practices shape everyday life_. Cornell University Press.

- Book considers - How people have dalth with the "millions" of interlocking standards?

This introduction offers a short guide to the large terrain of sociotechnical under standings of standards, quantification, and formalization, with an emphasis on standardization. (p. 23)

- goal is to understand how standards are "phenomena worthy of study in their own right, from multiple social scientific points of view" (p. 4)

The chapters included in this book (and the eclectic collage of examples interspersed) constitute our attempts to ==grapple with the phenomena of standardization and quantification in several domain==s: biology, public news media, food preparation, work and labor units, insurance, education, and everyday activities such as shopping. (p. 4)

**Book looks at analytic commonalities** 

	- ==Nested== - the ways they fit inside each other i.e. taxation standards in USA

The formal techniques described by Florence Millerand and Geoffrey Bowker (chap. 6 in this volume), such as quantification, are nested within other standards in order to summarize information; metadata are nested within a whole system of standards.

		- ==Distributed unevenly== - "sociotechnical standards are distributed unevenly" (p. 6) i.e. standardized testing, work-hour, speaking English

[Read Chapter 7] - The implementation of most programs has until recently (and even now, although things are better) relied on a system of encoding, ASCII, that disproportionately disadvantaged people whose alphabet used non-ASCII characters. (p. 6)

		- ==Relative to the User and Communities of Practice== - "standard forms are also relative in their impact"
		- ==Integrated== - interlocking systems i.e. the Internet 

For e-mail to function properly, these standards must be integrated one with the other, beginning with the source of access to the Internet (the service provider) , software for presenting messages from many sources and in many formats, and telephonic and other carrier standards, and continuing right down to the machine code in the terminal or computer on the desktop and out to the Internet with its complex, evolving sets of handshakes and protocols (see Abbate 1999).

		- ==Embody Ethics and Values== - gendered questions ("transsexuals"), mulit-ethnic/racial questions 

- ==An invisibility in consideration of standards== - overlooked nature

Yet the standards, numbers, and models tend to be ==black boxes== in their own right.

- Authors use "standardizing" throughout book - purpose to streamline procedures or regulate behaviours
- ==Why standardize?== - standardization is considered to be a necessary technique designed to facilitate other tasks (p. 10)
	- because standards are so pervasive that they have become taken for granted in our everyday environment, they may become completely embedded in everyday tools of use
	- In footnote - relationship to modernity: "Please note that standardization is not exclusive to modernity per sc, but it has accelerated with its dectronic and global forms, as already described." (p. 10)

- ==Standards are boring== (p. 11) - overlooked by social science 

The authors in this book share an ecological sense of the worlds of infrastructure... This means overcom ing the initial boredom of analysis and, furthermore, practicing a deeper ecology than that of input output or systems analysis. We have to listen to infrastructure and bring imagination to understanding its components and how they work.
- the challenge it o figure out which threads to unravel to make visible and lively
- authors =="interrogated stories of inevitability of technological developmentt and the neutrality of quantification"==

...when does a structure become a structure and when is a social actor an agent are part and parcel of the story to be told here.

- Standards - always already incomplete and inadequate character
	- a lot of work goes into creating and adjucating a standard - standardization is a recursive practice - necessarily historical and embeded in a series of complex events and social structures
-  Frustration with standards:
The association of standards with irrationality demonstrates, as litrle else can, Max Weber's powerful i nsight that the move toward modern rationality necessarily resulted in forms of irrationality.

- ==Types of standards== - key qs: What is being standardized, and who is being standardized? What is the difference between a gold standard and a working standard? (p. 15)
	- paralell of the building of WWW to railroad infrastructure - Link to [[Carse - Keyword Infrastructure]]

Clearly, coordinating communication over the World Wide Web or between computers in different sites has necessitated extensive work to ensure ease of data movement and flow, akin perhaps to the grand projects of building railroads and cutting deep river channels to facilitate the movement of goods in the nineteenth century (prompting the use of the metaphor of the superhighway). (p. 16)

- ==Scale and distribution and degrees of distribution== - links to Latour's "action at a distance" 
	- delegation as managed via home-testing kits

- ==What is infrastructure?==
	- Link to [[Carse - Keyword Infrastructure]]
	- Connection to standardization 

... infrastructure is something that other things " run on," things that are substrate to events and movements: railroads, highways, plumbing, electricity, and, more recently, the information superhighway. (p. 17)
- good infrastructure vs bad infra

However, in light of a deeper analysis of infrastructure, and especially to understand large-scale technical systems in the making or to examine the situations of those who are not served by a particular infrastructure, this image is both too shallow and too absolute.
- one person's infrastructure is another person's brick wall - i.e. graphics programmin of the WWW as useless to a blind person

Infrastructure is part of human organization and as problematic as any other. (p. 17)

If we study an information system and neglect its standards, wires and settings, we miss equally essential aspects of aesthetics, justice, and change. (p. 18)
- "infrastructural inversion" - foregorunding the boring parts

The known variables such as gender, race, status, career, power, and innovation trajectories are subtly represented in infrastructures, especially as they appear in processes of standardizing and quantifying (see Stern 2002). (p. 18)

- Intellectual Background: Science Studies
	- 1970s - Latour and Woolgar - ethnographic study *Laboratory Life* - qualitative, observational (p. 19)

lt used many of the same techniques as the earlier laboratory studies of science; however, it also directly engaged social scientists in studying communicating machines, the emergence of the personal computer (PC) and the World Wide Web, and attempts to model human behavior.

- the role of the "ethnographic eye" in studying infrastructure
- Whose ideas and things matter?
	- political events and structures influence how work is remembered - how attempts to standardize and remember may change radically over time

Within the computer and information sciences, ==there is a serious utopian dream of remembering everything equally== (for instance, there is a project begun years ago by computer scientist Douglas Lenat, the Cyc project, to store all commonsense knowledge into a huge electronic
encyclopedia).

This book lives in the middle and offers a number of empirical examples and analytic concepts that may help us, if not to clean up the messy imbrications, at least enjoy them, understand how they work, and minimize the suffering that overly specific or underly specific approaches may produce.
