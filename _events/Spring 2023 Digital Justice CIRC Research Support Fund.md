The Spring 2023 research support fund will open **Monday, April 3, 2023 at 9:00 AM EDT.** We will not be accepting applications prior to the fund opening, however, if you are certain you will need support with research for the Spring semester, please consider submitting your application as soon as you can. Unfortunately, we received too many applications to support last semester but look forward to supporting additional projects for the upcoming Spring term. You can preview the application form [here](https://forms.gle/AcQ7AwwN6owWoSYd6). I will also send a reminder email on March 31 to all cluster collaborators.
