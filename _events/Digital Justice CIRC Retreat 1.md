The theme of the retreat is Digital Justice, Knowledge and the Pluriverse. The gathering will act as an introduction to the members of the cluster and to the pluriverse framework we hope to facilitate. For this first reflection session, we will focus on digital justice via the question of community knowledge production, circulation and exchange. Question we ask during this first meeting include:

- How can we mobilize the digital to avoid common pitfalls and create new opportunities for community knowledge production and circulation? 

- In what ways does dealing with community knowledge necessarily include a transformation of academic research?
