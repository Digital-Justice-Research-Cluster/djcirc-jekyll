CineMobilia, mobile archiving and presentation will create an archival research creation project working with community members from Lawrence Heights. CineMobilia @ Heights will be held in the heart of Lawrence Heights - Toronto Community Housing's largest Revitalization project and almost double the size of Regent Park. Through Revitalization, this 100-acre site (40.5-hectares) south of Yorkdale Shopping Centre is being transformed. Revitalization will include replacing 1,208 Toronto Community Housing units and building over 4,000 new private market units, along with new parks, retail space, and roads connecting Lawrence Heights to the surrounding community.
