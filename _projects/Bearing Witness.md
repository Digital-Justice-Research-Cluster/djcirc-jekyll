This project seeks to collect and creatively disseminate graduate student’s experiences encountering hate and harassment online. Social media has become an increasingly important tool for scholars to extend their networks and build a public profile. Yet it is these same platforms that enable certain groups and individuals—often on the far-right—to conduct coordinated harassment campaigns that disproportionately target, women, queer, BIPOC, disabled and other marginalized scholars. As universities increasingly advance research committed to equity, diversity and inclusion, resources to support and protect students and faculty are gravely lacking at an institutional level. In addition to causing drastic harm to the careers and well-being of individual scholars, the long-term impacts of online harassment include what research is able to proceed, which perspectives are silenced, and which researchers are ultimately able to remain in the academy. This research project seeks offer students an opportunity to tell their stories safely and anonymously, so that institutions will be pressed to bear witness to their experiences. The project will unfold in two parts: first, gathering stories from students and collecting them into an archive (Fall 2022), and then inviting artists to engage with that archive and create original artworks in response to it (Winter 2023). During the Fall semester, the Research Assistant will be integral in obtaining research ethics clearance, conducting outreach to prospective participants, collecting stories and organizing a digital archive. For the second stage of the project (which we will be seeking further funding for) we envision inviting up to five artists to make original works that engage with the material held in the archive to be presented in an exhibition during Congress 2023, held at York University. Given the breadth of the issue of online harassment, and the need for inter-university collaboration to combat it, Congress is an optimal time to showcase this research and foster connections between advocates across disciplines and institutions. Pending additional funding, we hope to continue to employ the Research Assistant to facilitate an open call for artist proposals, coordinate artist selection, and provide hands-on support in assembling the final exhibition.
