Viral Interventions (VI) is a research-creation project that critically studies new methods for artists, communities and activists to work together, making films about urgent AIDS realities today. How do we navigate the considerable challenges of collaboration, when differing priorities, aesthetics and tactics (pedagogical, artistic, political) can place them at odds? How do we strike a balance between artistic independence and ethical engagement? What new hybrid cinema forms can emerge from such exchanges and differences? Why do we keep opening this door? VI explores the fertile possibilities of such collaborations, developing and testing innovative methods for making meaningful AIDS films that engage with our local and global realities today.
