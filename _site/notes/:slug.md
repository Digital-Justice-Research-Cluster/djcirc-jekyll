Viveiros de Castro, E. (2004). Perspectival anthropology and the method of controlled equivocation. _Tipití: Journal of the Society for the Anthropology of lowland South America_, 2(1), 1.

- paper is on "Amerindian perspectivism"

If culture, as Marilyn Strathern wrote, “…consists in the way people draw analogies between different domains of their worlds” (1992:47), then every culture is a gigantic, multidimensional process of comparison. (p. 2)

- makes the claim that perspectivism projects an image o translation as a process of ==controlled equivocation== (p. 5)
	- "controlled" how walking may be said to be a controlled way of falling
- ==perspectivism as a cosmology==
	- imagines a universe peopled by different subjective agencies - human and nonhuman - with souls 
	- human and non-human perspectives found in the "objective correlative" - manioc beer to jaguars and blood to humans (p. 6)

- world within many worlds: 

Hence, where our modern, anthropological multiculturalist ontology is founded on the mutual implication of the unity of nature and the plurality of cultures, the Amerindian conception would suppose a spiritual unity and a corporeal diversity—or, in other words, one “culture,” multiple “natures.”  (p. 6)

...==perspectivism supposes a constant epistemology and variable ontologies,== the same representations and other objects, a single meaning and multiple referents.

Amerindian ontologies are inherently comparative: they presuppose a comparison between the ways different kinds of bodies “naturally” experience the world as an affectual multiplicity. (p. 7)
- European ethnocentrism - doubted whether bodies have the same souls at them; Amerindian ethnocentrism consisted of doubting whether souls have had the same bodies
- Levi-Strauss:

But Lévi-Strauss introduces an asymmetry, observing tongue-in-cheek that, in their investigations into the humanity of the other, the Whites invoked the social sciences, while the Indians placed more trust in the natural sciences. (p. 8)

- anthropology is about misunderstandings 
	-  ==equivocation== is is not just one among other possible pathologies that threaten communication between the anthropologist and the "native"

Accordingly, even when misunderstandings are transformed into understandings—like when the anthropologist transforms his initial bewilderment at the natives’ ways into “their culture,” or when the natives understand that what the Whites called, say, “gifts” were in reality “commodities”—even here such understandings persist in being not the same.

- presents another example through anthropological analysis 
	- Greg Urban - society - organization must created - created by culture, "circulating discourse"
	- John Searle - two types of facts:

Take the doctrine of John Searle (1995), for example, which argues that two and only two types of facts exist: “brute facts,” such as hills, rain and animals, and “institutional facts,” such as money, iceboxes or marriage. (p. 13)

It consists of a highly characteristic operation of translation, which involves the metaphysical demotion of the indigenous distribution of the world to the condition of metaphor: “Creation of the animal world is a metaphor for the creation of community” (Urban 1996:158).
- ex. jaguars as created:

For the Shokleng, in fact, culture is the given and nature is the constructed. For them, if the cat is on the mat, or rather, ==if the jaguar is in the jungle, it is because someone put it there. (p. 13)==
