<h1>Digital Reset: A Compendium of Creative and Speculative Approaches</h1>

<h4><strong>When:</strong> 23 May 2023 | 10:00 am - 4:00 pm EDT</h4> 

<p><strong>Register <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/digital-reset-a-compendium-of-creative-and-speculative-approaches-tickets-619290302967">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This series of three participatory, creative, and speculative workshops will take participants through a dissection, exploration and reinvention of the vicissitudes and joys of everyday life on social media platforms. These workshops aim to unravel the ambiguities of the position of the user, both those who craft, feed and identify with flows of information and those who are also shaped, tracked, prodded, targeted, modulated and ultimately betrayed through a massive industry of algorithmic manipulations, recommendations and personalization. The overall goal is to activate and reinvent ways of relating to digital media and to others via new media dis- and re-entanglements.</p>

<p>Participants will look and interact with their personal digital feeds through a series of deconstruction and reconstruction exercises. Using the “Data Double” (Roopa Vasudevan) browser plug-in, participants will explore how they are seen, perceived and constructed through an online tracking system. With “Image and Affect” (Ganaele Langlois) participants will uncover the often unperceived and complex affective charges of images that appear on their social media feeds.  These explorations will give way in the afternoon to creative reconstructions through performance and poetry exercises that focus on the concept of authenticity (Alex Juhasz and Ioana Juncan).</p>

<p>Throughout the day, participants can participate in building a living gallery of their layered experience of userhood as well, as curate digital objects to produce an online zine.</p>
