        <h1>Welcome to the Digital Justice Research Cluster</h1>

        <p>Against dystopian scenarios that would only see the growth in digital injustices, this proposed cluster takes on the task of imagining and enacting what digital justice could and should be. The first question driving our inquiry is: How can digital tools and processes be made accessible to communities for cultural production, information sharing, resilience, and inclusion?</p>

        <p>Inventing digital justice cannot be done without the meaningful involvement of the very communities that are currently marginalized, victimized, and oftentimes criminalized by digital infrastructures and processes. And research-creation is central to support such community-led work in that it fosters creative practices that can be a conduit and site for different forms of community knowledge production. Crucially, we also ask: How can we optimize the impact of community-led digital creative tools, practices, and expression with regards to public discourse, policy-making, and social dialogue?</p>
