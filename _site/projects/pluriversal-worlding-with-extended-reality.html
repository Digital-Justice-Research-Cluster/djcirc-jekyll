<h1>Pluriversal Worlding with Extended Reality</h1>
<h4><strong>PI:</strong> Mary Bunch</h4>

<p>Pluriversal Worlding with Extended Reality is a four-year research-creation project that re-imagines territories in Southwestern Ontario, including Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation, (KSP) as a pluriversal world. We use XR (virtual, augmented and mixed) worldmaking that “delinks” from modern humanist and colonial logics (Mignolo 2008) to seek colonial reparation and environmental justice. To engage comprehensively across the creative, ethical, and political stakes of such imaginaries, Pluriversal Worlding with Extended Reality has four key objectives.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create and exhibit a pluriversal XR world and stories that expresses and cultivates queer decolonial imaginaries: Working collaboratively, the team will develop a world within worlds and its stories, using several modalities of XR in different platforms.</li>
  <li>Cultivate new understandings of queer decolonial aesthetics and poetics in XR worldbuilding and storytelling: By rethinking worldmaking through a decolonial worlding framework (world as relational process), we generate new understandings of decolonial aesthetics and poetics in XR.</li>
  <li>Incubate innovative queer decolonial theory through pluriversal worlding and storytelling: Conceptualize and expand theory at the juncture of new media philosophy and the decolonial imaginary through intercultural dialogue and multiple ways of knowing.</li>
  <li>Engage in reparative relations with the KSP community, through creating and conducting a series of worldmaking workshops for community expression and storytelling in XR, skill training, and networking for opportunities in media arts careers.</li>
</ol>
