<h1>Student Gig Workers at York University</h1>
<h4><strong>PI:</strong> Kelly Bergstrom (collaborating with Sava Saheli Singh, Faculty of Education)</h4>

<p>This projects aims to examine the work/life balance of student app-based gig workers (e.g., food and grocery delivery via UberEats and other similar platforms) at York University. Student workers are increasingly drawn to app-based gig work as it provides greater flexibility and allows them control over their time while giving them an additional form of income – either to support their leisure activities or to supplement their tuition. This project will give us important insight into university student experiences with app-based gig work, especially as it relates to how students balance work, academics, and leisure. This project is also intended as a pilot for the data collection protocols (survey and interview guide) for a larger SSHRC Insight project that focuses on how gig workers and remote workers create leisure time alongside their gig work.</p>

<p>To explore how student gig workers balance work, domestic obligations, academic responsibilities, and leisure, we will conduct a qualitative inquiry consisting of surveys and interviews. We will recruit 100 survey participants and 25-30 interview participants from the York University student body between January and December 2023. The data we collect will be analyzed using the Nvivo software suite. As this is an exploratory pilot, we will conduct thematic coding with a focus on how students describe their experiences of gig work, and how they balance other aspects of their lives like academics, family life, and leisure. We will also examine how intersections of gender, income, race, and immigration status impact their experiences and access to gig work.</p>

<p>Our findings from this project will be relevant to the study of gig workers, but also to provide York University with additional information about the challenges students may face as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and begin to imagine what this “new normal” might look like.</p>
